# This is a repository to store the various scripts I use on my linux Desktop.

For now they are all in bash but I may use python or something like that in the future. This will be where I keep most the things that I write to put in my "Tools" directory. I don't see any reason why these shouldn't be available to others for educational or personal use. I doubt you'll find any commercial use from these but if you do then by all means go for it.

## scripts

1. ### [cpp_gen.sh](./bash/cpp_gen.sh)
   generates a c++ cmake project using ninja.
2. ### [compressHome.sh](./bash/compressHome.sh)
   compresses the contents of my home directory and zips it for backup
3. ### [encrypt.sh](./bash/encrypt.sh)/[decrypt.sh](./bash/decrypt.sh)
   locally encrypts and decrypts files respectively. Uses GPG.
4. ### [diary_entry_gen.sh](./bash/diary_entry_gen.sh)
   generates a diary entry in my local filesystem. Should be fairly portable and work with minor changes for anyone else.
5. ### [sort_downloads.sh](./bash/sort_downloads.sh)
   pretty self explanatory. Sorts your downloads folder.
6. ### [strip_exif.sh](./bash/strip_exif.sh)
   strip the gps related exif data from a photo or dir of photos.
7. ### [nord_set_obfuscate.sh](./bash/nord_set_obfuscate.sh)
   for use with nordvpn cli. Changes technology to openvpn, enables obfuscate and connects, or does the inverse.
